# Blaze Diagnostics App

Blaze Diagnostics is a workshop management and customer communication system for mechanical workshops.

The system is intended to improve communication between workshops and clients by tracking vehicle jobs, quote approvals, parts ordering, parts delivery, mechanic progress, invoicing, and collection readiness.

## Current Technical Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, modular service/controller/repository structure
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Current ORM in the uploaded app: Prisma
- Earlier planning referenced: Drizzle ORM
- Version control: GitHub

Important: The current uploaded application uses Prisma. Do not assign Drizzle implementation work until the ORM direction has been confirmed. See `docs/technical/ORM_DECISION_NOTE.md`.

## Student Groups Using This Repository

This repository has been adjusted for the current CTU Bloemfontein internship groups:

- Software Engineering 1
- Software Engineering 2
- Software Development 1
- Software Development 2
- Cloud Administration
- Cyber Security

Architectural Draughting students should use the separate `synergy-inc-architectural-draughting` repository.

## Repository Bootstrap

### Workspace Layout

- `backend/` - API and domain modules
- `frontend/` - Next.js application
- `docs/` - product, API, schema, training, backlog, and internship documents
- `.github/` - GitHub issue and pull request templates

### Quick Start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` if required.
3. Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local`.
4. Start local services with `docker-compose up -d`.
5. Install dependencies in the required workspace.
6. Run the relevant database generate/migrate/seed commands once confirmed by the mentor.
7. Start the backend.
8. Start the frontend.

## Student GitHub Workflow

Students must not commit directly to `main`.

Expected workflow:

1. Read the issue.
2. Create a branch.
3. Make a small focused change.
4. Test or review your work.
5. Commit with a clear message.
6. Push the branch.
7. Open a pull request.
8. Respond to review feedback.

## Security Rule

Never commit passwords, API keys, database URLs, tokens, `.env` files, personal credentials, or private customer information.
